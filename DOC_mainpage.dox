\section intro_sec Introduction

LATField2, the second version of the LATfield library is a simple C++ framework for lattice based simulation on massively parallel computer.

Changes in respect to LATfield:

- the parallelization has been rebuilt to distribute 2 of the lattice dimensions into a 2-dimensional MPI process grid.
- A FFT wrapper for 3d cubic lattices. 
- HDF5 I/O (serial and parallel).
- An I/O server has been implemented to improve I/O from compute nodes. (Beta)

\section install_sec Downloads

The current stable version can be downloaded at: http://www.latfield.org


For user who would like to contribute to LATfield, the library git repository is on gitHub: https://github.com/daverio/LATfield2.git


\section getstart_sec Getting Started

The best way to start with LATfield is to jump into the examples starting with the "getting started" example. The FFT example will explain the usage of the PlanFFT class and the IOserver example the IO server. There is a fourth example which show how to build a Poisson solver, but is currently not documented.
